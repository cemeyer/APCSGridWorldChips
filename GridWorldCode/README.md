This was something I put together in high school. The code isn't great. It is
based on the AP CS GridWorld framework (GPL), and (ab)uses it to render tiles
from a map as well as sprites. You can consider my contributions MIT or GPL
licensed at your preference.

The Chip's Challenge level files and sprites are not my work, and I don't know
their legal status. I think the original game is abandonware at this point. If
anyone has rights to the Windows distribution, I'd guess it is Microsoft Home.
But I doubt they care too much about Chip's Challenge anymore.

There are some hardcoded resource paths in the source, so some modification is
required to build and run on your own system. I didn't know much about Java
packaging in high school, and guess what, I still don't. Good luck.
